# user-profile-portal

I want a website that covers these parameters:
User profiles: Each user would have a profile that includes their portfolio, contact information, and other relevant information.

Service categories: These would be created based on the portfolios uploaded by the users. The categories would be defined based on the skills, knowledge, and experience demonstrated in the portfolios.
